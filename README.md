# Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my academic and personal projects.

## Contents

- **University Projects**: Coursework and research projects from my studies, including statistical analyses and econometric modeling.
- **Current Projects**: Ongoing work exploring data science, machine learning, and applied statistics beyond university.

Most projects involve statistical or econometric models, but some extend into broader areas of data analysis and programming.


Feel free to explore the code and methods I've used. This portfolio reflects both my academic background and my growing practical experience.
